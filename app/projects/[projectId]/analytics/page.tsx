              <li><b>Feature Impact:</b> Customers who used the new dashboard feature at least 3 times per week reported a 1.2-point higher satisfaction score and were 2.5x more likely to recommend the product.</li>

              <li><b>Engagement Drop-off:</b> 24% of users show a sharp engagement drop after the first month, correlating with a lack of personalized follow-up and unclear value communication.</li>
